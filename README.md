# Skystandards

[Skynet](https://siasky.net/) is a decentralized environment where data is accessible from different applications. Having a standard for data is therefore crucial for applications to communicate with each other. This repo aims to be a proposal for **data standards to be adopted in Skynet applications** in such a way that users can share and use their data in different Skynet apps, thus reaping the benefits and exploiting the full potential of Skynet.

This project is in its embryonic stage. Feel free to collaborate and express your opinion in order to create a free and decentralized internet that we like.
