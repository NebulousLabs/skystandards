# skystandards

Skynet is a decentralized environment where the data is accessible from different applications. Having a standard for data is therefore crucial for applications to communicate with each other. This repo aims to be a proposal for data standards to be adopted in Skynet applications in such a way that users can share and use their data in different Skynet apps, thus reaping the benefits and exploiting the full potential of Skynet.

This is a whole new project so feel free to collaborate and express your opinion in order to create a free and decentralized internet that we like.
